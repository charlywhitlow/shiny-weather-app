# shiny-weather-app

This Shiny app was created as part of a university project, outlined in Project_brief_2022.pdf

We were provided with files containing weather data for 20 weather stations, and asked to build a shiny app displaying and summarising the data, including calculating the Hutton Criteria.

The app can be viewed in action on shinyapps.io:
